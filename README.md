# Project Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Simplified MNIST Dataset

From $64\times 64$ images we divide them into $4\times 4$ chunks. The number of pixels in those chunks are the new pixel values. Thus, we end up with a $8 \times 8$ images from the original $64 \times 64$ size. This should be a manegable image for the more simple and classic Machine Learning Algorithms and methods that we see on this course.
